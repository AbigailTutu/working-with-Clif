So i have added nodemon package so that you don't have to restart the server again and again.

the first you need to do is cd in the fun-Practices directory by using the following command.

```bash
ls
```

This ls command will the list of all the files and folders in the current directory.

```bash
 cd fun-Practices
```

This will change the directory to fun-Practices
then you have to install the node modules by using the following command.

```bash
 npm install
```

after run this command you will see a folder named node_modules in the current directory.

then you have to start the server by using the following command.

```bash
 npm start
```

This will start the server and you can see the output on the console.
